Done as time permits.

## 2022

Languages used:

 * J
 * C#

 C# was used on day01 in order to finish it fast. There is a competition at my job and I didn't know if they would count time. They only count stars.

 So I won't need to do them twice and I can try hard mode again.

 The most innovative thing I'm doing is that I'm using my Steam Deck as my computer. My other personal computers are a Raspberry pi or over 8 years old.

## 2021

languages used:

* C# via .Net interactive notebooks in vscode

## 2020

languages used

* C#
* Some days done one part with J

This year I decided to take it in "easy mode" as it's in a language that I use almost daily. The only divergences are that I'm doing it with Visual Studio Code and dotnet 5, instead of my usual tools.

## 2019

languages used:

* J : https://www.jsoftware.com

day 1 done
day 4 half day done

Quite a nice programming language, dense enough to be used on mobile.
Unfortunately it seems read only, as in it's easier to write than to read.
Some slight divergences between mobile and computer because I took shorcuts on mobile (didn't load or parse the file).
On Day 2 (the first of the intcode days) I had some problems trying to parse the input file, so I didn't do it, or the rest of the intcode days.
I tried to do other days, but I really have to take it with more time.

## 2018

languages used:
red programming language: https://www.red-lang.org/

day 1  done  
day 2  done, in process of improving  
day 3  pending  
day 4  pending  

This language is a bit esoteric for my taste, but I love the single executable that was small and had lots of power, it brought me memories of times past with small, but powerful, programs.

## 2017

languages used:

* common lisp (SBCL)

Done in 2017.

What I did was full days 1 to 9, half 10, full 11, 13, 15 and 17.

Unfortunately not all the solutions have been found by my search of code.

Mostly done on the phone, with some work at home.

day 1 was done on scratch in the phone, lost forever

days with code: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15

I would have loved to do common lisp at university, but when I took the course when they taught it it was changed to "multimedia", and so I learned HTML/CSS instead.
